- ['A Fluorescent Bulb II' sound effects library by A Sound Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baUq5va4w3U) , This base effect was taken, put through an echo and enhancement filter, as well as recut to have the beginning portion repeat, and the middle portion have a more jarring transition.
- ['Hum SOUND EFFECT - Fluorescent Humming Lampen Brummen SOUNDS Neon Light SOUND FX by BerlinAtmospheres'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BL8B_yh2iJs) , This effect was downloaded, put into a video editing software and recut to be longer and more sustained through the equalization effect. It was also put through the chorus, amplify, distort and echo effects to produce the background sound for various scenes.
